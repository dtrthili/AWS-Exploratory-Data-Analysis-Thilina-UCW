**Project Description:** 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Property Tax Report - City of Vancouver


**Project Title:** 

Emphasis on Land values on legal types: An Exploratory Data Analysis


**Objective:** 

The primary goal of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Property Tax dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to land values. By analyzing various features such as legal type, previous value, and current value, we aim to understand how property valuation has changed.


**Dataset:** 

The Property Tax dataset consists of information such as:

•	PID: Unique identifier for each property

•	Legal-Type: Categories of legal: Land / Strata / Other

•	Street-Name: Street Name

•	Property-Postal: Postal Code

•	Previous-Land-Value: Previous Land Value

•	Current-Land-Value: Current Land Value

•	Report-Year: Year

**Methodology:**


**1-	Data Collection and Preparation:**

o	Download the Property Tax report from the City of Vancouver - Open Data Portal 

(https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/property-tax-report/information/?sort=-tax_assessment_year&refine.zoning_classification=Limited+Agriculture&dataChart=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)

o	Design the process by using draw.io.

I used the S3 bucket to store my dataset. By using AWS Glue Data Brew, I created a project and cleaned my data (without null values/correct data formats, etc.). The cleaned data again stored in the S3 bucket in a different folder. By using AWS Glue, I created a pipeline to generate appropriate data and save it in a different folder in the S3 bucket.


**2-	Data Ingestion:**

I have used an S3 bucket for my data file. I used Standard storage since I needed to access the data regularly. Bucket bc-proptax-raw will have a folder (Property-Tax).


**3-	Data Profiling:**

I have used AWS Glue Data Brew for Data Profiling. By creating a project called 'bc-proptax-project', I have created another bucket for the transform data. In that bucket, I have another folder for the Data Profiling output.

Profile Output:

**4-	Data Cleaning:**

Instead, to clean this data, I have made a new folder than the profiling one. In this folder, there are System and User folders. The output will go respectively according to Legal Type. Also, I have saved the recipe for future reference as well.

Cleaned data output (System):

Cleaned data output (User):

**5-	Data Pipeline Design:**

I used the filter option to filter the ‘Land records in 2020’. The output for this pipeline will save the records in respective places under the Property Tax folder → Land Average folder in the S3 bucket.

Comparing the results which are generated by using Amazon Athena with the City of Vancouver - Open Data Portal:

**Conclusion:**
o	Generated reliabile outputs for calculating the averages of land values (Current and Previous).

o	Tools and Technologies:

•	AWS - Amazon S3 / AWS Data Glue / Amazon Athena


This EDA project not only demonstrates my analytical and programming skills but also highlights my ability to derive meaningful insights from data, making it a valuable addition to my data analyst portfolio.
